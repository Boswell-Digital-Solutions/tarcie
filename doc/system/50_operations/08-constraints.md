# 8. Constraints

All v1 constraints are hardcoded in `constraints.rs`. They are non-negotiable.

## The Five Rules

### 1. Capture Latency: 5-Second Revert

If any capture operation (note or marker) takes longer than 5 seconds, the operation must revert. The user must never be blocked waiting for a capture to complete. This protects the "friction-free" guarantee -- if the queue is broken, the user should not notice.

### 2. Write-Only (No Readback)

The UI is strictly write-only in v1. There is no command, endpoint, or surface to read back captured events. Data flows in one direction: user to queue to sink. SMITH handles all downstream consumption.

### 3. No Categorization

Tarcie does not categorize, tag, or group events beyond extracting a literal `#tag` string from note content. All semantic grouping, trend analysis, and categorization is the responsibility of SMITH.

### 4. No AI / No LLMs

Tarcie processes raw strings only. There is no AI, no LLM, no inference, no embeddings, no summarization. Content is captured verbatim and flushed verbatim.

### 5. Small, Non-Blocking UI

The overlay window is 480x140px. It must never block other applications. It appears on hotkey, accepts input, and disappears. No modal dialogs, no confirmation prompts, no settings screens.
